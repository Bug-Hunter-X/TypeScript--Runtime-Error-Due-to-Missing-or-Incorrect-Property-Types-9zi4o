This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in TypeScript: runtime errors caused by the unexpected absence of properties or incorrect property types in objects.  The `bug.ts` file shows the problematic code, which lacks runtime checks to prevent errors when the input object does not conform to the expected structure.  `bugSolution.ts` provides a solution that utilizes optional properties and type guards to enhance robustness.
